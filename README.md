# Level-2 Python Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts developed during my Level-2 internship at Cognifyz. The scripts cover a variety of tasks, including problem-solving challenges and practical coding exercises.

## Tasks Included

1. **Task 1: Number Guessing Game**  
   A Python program that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it.

2. **Task 2: Number Guesser**  
   A simple Python function that checks if the user's guessed number matches a randomly generated number.

3. **Task 3: Password Strength Checker**  
   A Python function that evaluates the strength of a password based on its length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

4. **Task 4: Fibonacci Sequence**  
   A Python program that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

5. **Task 5: File Manipulation**  
   A Python program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word, displaying the results in alphabetical order.
